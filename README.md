***Customer Segmentation Project***

The goal of this project was to segment a retail business' customers into groups to understand spending behavior, allow for better marketing efforts and to optimize revenue.
Customers were grouped into clusters using K-means clustering algorithm in Excel and findings were visualized using BI tool, Tableau.

Insights from visualizations in Tableau showed:

1. Cluster 1 Customers are High Earners and High Spenders
2. Cluster 2 Customers are Low Earners and High Spenders
3. Cluster 3 Customers are High Earners and Low Spenders
4. Preferred Product Categories for all Clusters

Insights from the EDA informed the following recommendations:
1. Products peculiar to Cluster 1 Customers should always be in stock
2. Provide discounted products to Cluster 2 customers
3. Targeted Marketing ads should be made towards Cluster 3 customers to influence their spending habits.
